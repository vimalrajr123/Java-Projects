2. What Is Cascading?
Entity relationships often depend on the existence of another entity, 
for example the Person–Address relationship. Without the Person, 
the Address entity doesn't have any meaning of its own. When we delete the Person entity, 
our Address entity should also get deleted.

Cascading is the way to achieve this. When we perform some action on the target entity, 
the same action will be applied to the associated entity.

2.1. JPA Cascade Type
All JPA-specific cascade operations are represented by the javax.persistence.CascadeType enum containing entries:

ALL
PERSIST
MERGE
REMOVE
REFRESH
DETACH

3.1. CascadeType.ALL
CascadeType.ALL propagates all operations — including Hibernate-specific ones — from a parent to a child entity.

3.2. CascadeType.PERSIST
The persist operation makes a transient instance persistent. Cascade Type PERSIST propagates the persist operation 
from a parent to a child entity. 
When we save the person entity, the address entity will also get saved.

3.3. CascadeType.MERGE
The merge operation copies the state of the given object onto the persistent object with the same identifier. 
CascadeType.MERGE propagates the merge operation from a parent to a child entity.

3.4. CascadeType.REMOVE
As the name suggests, 
the remove operation removes the row corresponding to the entity from the database and also from the persistent context.

3.5. CascadeType.DETACH
The detach operation removes the entity from the persistent context. When we use CascadeType.DETACH, 
the child entity will also get removed from the persistent context.
